# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze how the selected "Green Stocks" performed for the years 2017 and 2018. My client wants the ability to analyze a larger set of stocks in the future in order to be able to use this code to perform analysis on a larger set of stocks refactor the VBA code from the "All Stock Analysis" to create a more efficient run time. 
## Results
After reviewing the results, the stock that performed the best for 2017 was "SEDG" returning 184.5% and for 2018 was "RUN" returning 84%. Overall, 2017 outperformed 2018 stocks significantly however there were two stocks that returned a positive gain in both years, "ENPH" and "RUN." After refactoring the code from "All Stocks Analysis" the run time of the refactored macro was significantly more efficient. The runtime was reduced by approximately 85% for both years analysis.

## Summary
1. The advantages for refactoring code is to enhance the original code efficiency without affecting the end results and to eliminate redundant or unclear code. The main disadvantages of refactoring code are introducing bugs and essentially breaking a functioning code that operates.
2. The main advantage of the original code was that it was functional. The advantages for refactoring the "All Stocks Analysis" code were to increase run time and efficiency to create the opportunity to increase the number of stocks analyzed in future projects.
